# Datasets

Two sources, cross-checked on 2026-11-01:

- the **Identity Ladder Dataset Tree**, the project's catalogue of what kinds of identity data exist (291 rows, each
  found by one research agent and checked against the official page or data paper by a second; private claude.ai
  artifact, version 1793522584-f862). Its summary, decision points, first batch and full catalogue are reproduced
  from the "Dataset Tree" section on;
- the shared data registry (`_registry/datasets.json` of the data root), which records what is actually local, with
  licence and access as recorded there.

The first sections cover the datasets this project uses or plans to use, with facts checked against each dataset's
own metadata where stated. No local paths and no participant IDs. "Licence as recorded" quotes the registry; it is
not legal advice. GRAPE, UPOL, UTIRIS, IXI and SIMON are local but not in the tree; QTIM is in the tree only as an
unverified lead (see "Corrections to the tree").

Project rule for all real data: real images, per-case tables and real-case figures stay in the local data root and
never enter this public repository, whatever the licence allows. The repository holds code, aggregate results and
synthetic figures.

## Brain MRI

| Dataset | Source | Licence as recorded | Local status | Rungs it serves | Redistribution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QTIM (Queensland Twin IMaging), registry id `siblings-mri` | OpenNeuro ds004169 v1.0.8, doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds004169.v1.0.8 | CC0 in the dataset's `dataset_description.json`; registry entry updated 2026-11-01 (licence, version, DOI, acquisitions with SHA-256 manifests) | partial: 244 of 1,202 participants local (278 T1w scans) after the 2026-11-01 download of the 244 frozen real-case scans and their JSON sidecars; metadata complete | repeat scan (test-retest subsample, N = 78, interval about 3.5 months); later visit (longitudinal subsample, N = 62, interval about 3.5 years, adolescents); other hemisphere; family member; stranger; population mean | CC0 permits it; project rule above applies |
| SIMON | not recorded in the registry ("original URLs/licence must be retained") | "terms to verify" | raw present: one person, 73 sessions, 99 T1 acquisitions | same session, another day, other scanner or protocol, years later (one person only) | terms to verify: do not re-host |
| IXI | https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/ | CC BY-SA 3.0, verified at the original site 2026-10-18 | raw present | strangers, other centres | allowed under CC BY-SA 3.0; project rule above applies |
| SRPBS traveling subjects | not recorded | "agreement governed per user; no agent analysis before review" | archive present, not opened | other scanner, many people (planned) | agreement governs; no agent access until Kate reviews the terms |
| BraTS inpainting 2023 and 2025 | Synapse (challenge data and winner models) | not checked: needs Kate's own registration and acceptance of the terms | not local, not in the registry | the challenge fills to be scored on the ladder (planned) | challenge terms govern |
| MNI ICBM152 template | bundled with nilearn (symmetric ICBM152 2009a; used as registration target) | not recorded in the registry | installed with nilearn | registration target, not a rung | not redistributed by this project |

QTIM facts checked against `participants.tsv`, `participants.json` and the dataset README (aggregates only):

- 1,202 participants in 682 families: 445 families of two, 36 of three, 1 of four, 200 single participants.
- There is no zygosity column. The README states that zygosity exists but requires a data transfer agreement and
  institutional ethics approval through QIMR Berghofer. With the public release, a relative is a "family member"
  (co-twin of unknown zygosity, or non-twin sibling), not MZ or DZ.
- Each session holds one T1w scan. `ses01_T1w_acq` and `ses02_T1w_acq` record the acquisition orientation (coronal or
  sagittal), changed by a scanner software upgrade; the README warns that a vascular pulsation artefact varies with
  orientation. There is no same-session repeat, so the L0 rung is not available in QTIM.
- MRIQC image quality metrics and FreeSurfer 5.3 measures are released as derivatives (not yet downloaded).
- Local T1w before 2026-11-01: 22 first-session scans and 12 second-session scans; 12.4 MB per scan on average (34 local scans); the release has 1,342 T1w scans (1,202 first sessions, 140 second), about 17 GB at that average.
- Downloaded 2026-11-01 (`src/real_cases_fetch.py`): the 244 T1w scans of the frozen real-case selection, 2.69 GB (11.0 MB per scan), from version-pinned snapshot 1.0.8 URLs, each verified by size and S3 ETag MD5, plus their 244 JSON sidecars for the descriptive data-QC report. SHA-256 manifests are private, next to the selection; the scan manifest hash is in `docs/PROTOCOL_real_cases.md`, Amendment 2. The expanded A1.1 set (826 scans) follows.

## Eye and iris

## Other 2D biometric sets (registered for this project, not used in any result)

Downloaded on 2026-10-31 and 2026-11-01 as candidates for 2D ladders. Which rungs each can serve has not been audited.
The registry rule for all of them: never print file names or show images in prompts or outputs.

|---|---|---|
| `identity-ladder-visual-detail-20261101` | prepared QTIM and UTIRIS cases for the detailed visual comparisons: image and participant mappings, case-level scores, figures | local only; source restrictions retained |

## Not available

- Zygosity for QTIM: needs a data transfer agreement and ethics approval (see above).
- Any repeat within one QTIM session (L0): not acquired by the study.

## Corrections to the tree

- QTIM (OpenNeuro ds004169) is filed under "head: ear" as an unverified lead. It is brain MRI, verified here against
  its own metadata (see "Brain MRI" above), and partly local. Moved to "tomography: brain".
- CASIA-Twins is filed under "tomography: brain"; its own evidence describes face, iris and fingerprint. Moved to
  "head: face 2D / video".
- CFP (Celebrities in Frontal-Profile) is filed under "eye: fundus"; it is a face set. Moved to "head: face 2D / video".
- The QTIM longitudinal interval: the tree says four years, `participants.json` says about 3.5 years.
- Other rows are reproduced as filed; they were not re-audited row by row here.

## The Dataset Tree: what kinds of data exist

Counts per kind of data and status, from the tree (291 rows). Status: "download now" is open without an account; "your action" needs an account or terms that Kate accepts herself; "decision" must be requested (data transfer agreement, institutional signature); "lead" is an unverified pointer; "cut" has no access route, cannot be verified or is commercial.

## Masked and occluded faces (not yet in the tree)

Added 2026-11-02 for the occlusion lessons in [FACE_ID_LESSONS.md](FACE_ID_LESSONS.md) and theme 8 of the backlog. These rows are not in the Dataset Tree or the registry (changing those needs the maintenance lock in `data/AGENTS.md`), so the counts below do not include them. Nothing was downloaded.
